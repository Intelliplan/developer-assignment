#### HowTo's

##### Gems
The project uses [bundler](http://www.bundler.io) to manage gems.

All you need to do is to install bundler:
```bash
$ gem install bundler
```
And install the needed gems:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

##### Nuget and packages
Nuget needs to be on you **PATH**.

To restore your packages simply run:

```bash
$ bundle exec rake restore
```


##### Rake tasks (noteworthy)


```ruby
$ bundle exec rake quick_build #compiles with detailed info
$ bundle exec rake test        #restores nuget, builds and run tests
$ bundle exec rake run         #restores nuget, builds and runs the program
$ bundle exec rake -T          #see available rake tasks
```

##### NOTE!
Please resend the assignment intact as a **zip-archive**. That is, in the same structure you got it, *with* all the files that came with it.

#### Good Luck!
