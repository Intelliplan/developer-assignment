Just to be clear. The purpose of the assignment is for you to show how you code, reason and design. Not take forever and be difficult.

### Regarding tools and external libraries
You are allowed to add in a testing and mocking framework of your choice. We won't however allow other "helping" frameworks. What comes with .net should be sufficient.

#### HowTo's

##### Gems
The project uses [bundler](http://www.bundler.io) to manage gems.

All you need to do is to install bundler:
```bash
$ gem install bundler
```
And install the needed gems:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

##### Nuget and packages
Nuget needs to be on you **PATH**.

To restore your packages simply run:

```bash
$ bundle exec rake restore
```


##### Rake

To compile the project
```bash
$ bundle exec rake quick_build
```

To run specs
```bash
$ bundle exec rake test
```


##### NOTE!
Please resend the assignment intact as a **zip-archive**. That is, in the same structure you got it, *with* all the files that came with it.

#### Good Luck!
